					<p> Get ready for our annual beer pong championship. Every year, this exhilarating battle ends friendships, and produces true champions. This 50 round double elimination tournament will test everything you thought you knew about yourself and punish those who are not worthy of being crowned "THE BEER PONG GOD".</p>

					<p> I hope you like getting wet because the entire party is a "splash zone", and if you don't cannonball off the roof, were you really at a pool party? This property features a 1500 gallon pool and waterslide that has earned the name "The Wedgie Waterfall". </p>

					<p> There's going to be fireworks, there's going to be concerts, there's going to be yelling, and there's going to be cheering. If you don't like things getting loud and wild, then don't come, because complainers suck. </p>
